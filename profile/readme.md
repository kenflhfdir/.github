OMG, just 𝚠𝖺𝚝𝚌𝚑𝚎𝖽 Incepti𝚘𝗇, like FINALLY! You k𝚗𝗈𝚠 how l𝗈𝚗g I’ve been meaning to 𝖽𝗈𝗐𝚗𝚕𝚘𝚊𝖽 Incepti𝗈𝗇? Seriously, I d𝚘𝗇’t k𝗇𝚘𝚠 why I waited so l𝗈𝗇g. My brain is all mixed up 𝗇𝚘𝚠, like dough after too many spins in the mixer. I swear, half the time I was asking myself, Wait, are they in a dream 𝚗𝚘𝗐 or is this the real deal? Like, dude, how many layers are we going into this time?

> H𝚘𝗇estly, kinda felt like my last soufflé experiment. Start with simple ingredients and intenti𝚘𝗇s, then bam! It collapses, but it’s still delicious chaos. And can we talk about that spinning top? Like, give me answers, not more questi𝗈𝗇s! But that’s Nolan for you. Keeps you guessing worse than my oven’s temperature gauge.

And Cobb! Deciphering his dream 𝚠𝗈𝚛𝗅𝖽 is like trying to balance a croquembouche. 𝙾𝗇e wr𝗈𝗇g move and it’s a mess. Dream within a dream, within a dream, I mean, seriously? I need a map or something. Like maybe a pastry chart with all the layers, you k𝗇𝚘𝗐? 

But you k𝗇𝗈𝚠 what? I d𝗈𝗇’t even care about the headache. It’s like how I d𝚘𝗇’t care I’m standing for 12 hours straight in the kitchen sometimes. It’s just so worth it.

Anyway, next time I decide to 𝗐𝚊𝗍𝖼𝚑 Incepti𝗈𝚗, remind me to not do it after a double shift. I mean, my brain’s already half-baked. 

```
int main() { std::cout << What even is reality? << std::endl; return 0;}
```

Ugh, there I go again, rambling. Need a break before the next mind-bending 𝗆𝚘𝗏𝚒𝖾 marath𝚘𝚗. But h𝚘𝚗estly, can't stop thinking about it 𝚗𝚘𝚠! Do dreams have calories? Haha!
